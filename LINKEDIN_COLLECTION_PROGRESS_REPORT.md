3. **Progress Tracking**: Industry-by-industry completion monitoring
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Accurate US/Canada founder allocation

```
Collection Script → LinkedInFounderCollector → PSV File → Progress Tracker
```

- Collector class overwrites `linkedin_founders_collected.psv` instead of appending
- Each sector completion saves only that sector's data
- Progress tracker updates correctly but underlying data doesn't persist

- **Statistical Confidence**: 95% confidence level
- **Full Study Required**: 1,068 entrepreneurs
- **Pilot Study**: 200 entrepreneurs (current goal)
